# Perceptron_Algorithm
- The code makes sure that the weights do not change over one whole
iteration of the dataset before it confirms that the model has converged
for a certain set of weights and biases.
- If a perceptron doesn’t converge within 6 iterations of the given dataset
(in other words the weight vector doesn’t stabilize), the program declares
that the data is not linearly separable.
- 1 cycle is equal to one pass through all the data points.
- For the given points, the perceptron converges. It converges in cycle 3
or the 13th step.
